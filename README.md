The artwork selected by the group is characterized by rectangles of different sizes arranged linearly and forming a grid. Using the grid as the inspiration point, a study case was found in which the mouse movement track appears in the grid background as the mouse moves. As a result, the image technique like this one, which emphasizes mouse movements, are expected to be used on group artwork. For example, when the mouse moves within or near a rectangular block in the image, the rectangle may change size or color to capture the mouse's movement.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

A technique called Fading Grid might help the group implement the image techniques mentioned in part 1. As this code shows, when the mouse moves over the grid background, the small rectangular block it passes through changes from the original blue to red, and gradually returns to blue as the mouse moves away. This image technique helps to achieve the effect of mouse tracking in the group artwork by changing the color of the rectangular blocks touched by the mouse. At the same time, the effect of color gradients is a great improvement for visual art.
